# 🧠 Penetration Testing Scenario – Initial Case

## 💡 Starting Point

You are a **junior penetration tester** working for a cybersecurity company. Your company has been contracted to test the following software system:

* The system is accessed via a **web browser**.
* Users can **register** and, after registration, **log in**.
* Once logged in, a user can act either as a **reservist** (regular user) or an **administrator**.
* Administrators can **add, delete, and edit** both resources and reservations.
* Administrators can **remove users** (reservists).
* Reservists can **book resources** if they are **over 15 years old**.
* Resources can be booked **by the hour**.
* The reservation list is **visible without logging in**, but **user identities are hidden**.
* The client company requires the system to be **GDPR-compliant**.
* The software developer claims to follow the principles of **Privacy by Design (PbD)**.

The system is being developed in **phases**. In this first phase, you are testing **user registration** functionality.

You act as a **white-hat hacker**, using a **gray-box testing** approach. Your task is to identify as many **anomalies** and **vulnerabilities** as possible and **categorize** your findings.

## 🧾 Penetration Testing and the report Structure

Perform penetration testing and write a **report** ([Check the template report](test_report_template.md)).

---

# 🛡️ Quick guide to safe pen-testing

## 🔎 What is a penetration test?

A penetration test (pen test) is a controlled simulation of attacks against a system to find security problems **before** real attackers do. It includes planning, scanning, trying exploits (only when allowed), and writing a clear report with evidence and fixes.

---

## ⚖️ Legal & policy must-knows

You must **never** test systems you don’t have explicit permission to test. Doing so can be illegal and/or break contracts.

* **Get written permission.** If you don’t have a signed Rules-of-Engagement (RoE), don’t test.
* **Cloud providers:** Many providers (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) **restrict** testing that affects shared infrastructure or other tenants. If a site is hosted on Azure, that **doesn’t automatically** give permission to test it — check the provider rules and the owner’s authorization. Your interpretation was sensible: providers often forbid aggressive or cross-tenant tests, but owners can usually test their *own* resources if they follow provider policies.
* **No DoS unless explicitly allowed.** Flooding or destructive tests are typically banned.
* **Personal data (GDPR/privacy):** Avoid real user data; if you must touch it, document lawful basis and protect evidence.

---

## ✅ Short checklist — do this **before** running tests 

✍️ **Written RoE** signed by the system owner (targets, allowed tests, schedule, contacts).  
🔐 **Confirm ownership** of the target (account ID, tenant, or VM you control).  
📧 **Notify provider** if required (cloud hosts may ask you to notify/security-team).  
📍 **Limit scope**: test only listed hosts/IPs; exclude third parties.  
💾 **Backups & snapshots**: take them so you can revert after tests.  
☎️ **Emergency contacts**: ops, instructor, legal — reachable during tests.  
🔒 **Evidence plan**: where you store logs/screenshots and how they’re protected. 

---

## 🧪 Where to practice (safe options) 

Use isolated or purpose-built labs — do **not** test random internet sites.

🖥️ Local VMs / Docker / VirtualBox (host-only networks).  
☁️ Institution-owned cloud tenant (only if you own it and have approvals).  
🧩 Training platforms: **TryHackMe, Hack The Box, OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA** — safe and legal.  

---

## 🧰 What tools & actions are normally OK (with permission) 

🌐 Passive recon (public info, DNS) — low risk.  
🔑 Authenticated scans (when you have credentials) — medium risk.  
⚠️ Vulnerability scans — OK if scoped and scheduled.  
🔥 Manual exploitation — only in lab/snapshotted environments or with explicit permission.  
❌ DoS or wide network sweeps — usually forbidden.  

---

## 📝 Short RoE example sentence you can copy 

> “I request written authorization to perform controlled penetration testing on `vm-lab.example.local (10.0.0.10)` during 2025-11-25 09:00–16:00. Allowed activities: passive discovery, authenticated scanning, and controlled exploitation of intentionally vulnerable components. Not allowed: denial-of-service, testing of other tenants, or access to real user data. Contact: Instructor Name, +358 50 XXX XXXX.”

---

# 🧰 Setting up your pen-test lab 

**You have two lab options:**

* **Your own environment** (Docker on your machine or in Kali)
* **Centria CyberLab** (institutional lab; follow lab rules)

In **both options**, you will use [this compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vheikkiniemi/CybersecurityAndDataPrivacySpring2026/refs/heads/main/BookingSystem/Phase1/Part1/docker-compose.yml) for Phase 1, Part 1

> ⚠️ Do **not** expose lab services to the public Internet. Keep everything local.

---

## 🖥️ Your own environment (Docker on your machine or in Kali) 

**Prerequisites**

* Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
* A terminal (PowerShell, Terminal, bash)

---

### 🪟 VM approach (Kali + Docker)

* Use VirtualBox / VMware / Hyper-V.
* Inside the VM: install Kali (or Debian/Ubuntu plus tools) and Docker to run vulnerable apps and tools.

**Quick steps**

**1. Download Kali ISO: [https://www.kali.org](https://www.kali.org) (instructor will provide link / checksum).**  
**2. Create VM in VirtualBox**  
**3. Install Kali and update**  

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**4. Install Docker:**  [Follow the instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

**5. Create a clean lab folder**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/cyber-lab/phase1-part1
cd ~/cyber-lab/phase1-part1
```

**6. Download the compose file**  

```bash
wget -O docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vheikkiniemi/CybersecurityAndDataPrivacySpring2026/refs/heads/main/BookingSystem/Phase1/Part1/docker-compose.yml
```

**7. (Optional) Check what will run**  

```bash
sudo docker compose config
```

This validates the file and shows the final config.

**8. Start the lab stack**  

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
sudo docker compose ps
```

Wait until all services show **“Up”**. Then open the app URLs shown in the compose file (commonly `http://localhost:8000`).

**9. Test with penetration test tools (e.g. ZAP)**

**10. Stop / reset**  

```bash
# Stop containers (keep data)
sudo docker compose down
```

```bash
# Stop and remove volumes (fresh start)
sudo docker compose down -v
```

```bash
# Stop and remove images (fresh start)
sudo docker compose down --rmi all
```

**11. Quick troubleshooting**

* **“Ports already in use”** → stop whatever uses the port, or change mapping in an override.
* **Container restarts** → `sudo docker logs <service-name>` and check environment variables or volumes.
* **App not reachable** → confirm the port mapping and URL, run `docker compose ps`.
* **ZAP not responding** → confirm it’s bound to `127.0.0.1:8080` and not blocked by firewall.

---

### 🐳 Windows + Docker Desktop

**Prerequisites**

* Windows 10/11 (recent build).
* Docker Desktop installed (use WSL2 backend on Windows).
* PowerShell (run as Administrator for some steps).
* Git, curl or wget (optional).

**1. Install docker:** [Follow the instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

**2. Add yourself to the docker-users group (Important!)**

Docker Desktop creates a local group called `docker-users`. Add your Windows user to that group so you can run Docker without permission issues.

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
# add current user to docker-users
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "docker-users" -Member $env:UserName
```

After this, **log out and log back in** (or reboot) so the group membership takes effect.

> If `Add-LocalGroupMember` isn't available (older Windows), use Computer Management → Local Users and Groups → Groups → docker-users → Add your user.

**3. Start Docker Desktop**

* Launch **Docker Desktop** and let it finish initialization (WSL2 integration may install/ask to enable).
* Check Docker is working in PowerShell (no admin required now):

```powershell
docker version
docker compose version
```

**4. Prepare a working folder & download the compose file**  

Open PowerShell (regular user) and run:

```powershell
mkdir $HOME\cyber-lab\phase1-part1
cd $HOME\cyber-lab\phase1-part1

# download compose file (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vheikkiniemi/CybersecurityAndDataPrivacySpring2026/refs/heads/main/BookingSystem/Phase1/Part1/docker-compose.yml" -OutFile docker-compose.yml
```

**5. Start the lab stack (run as regular user)**

```powershell
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Wait until services show `Up`. Open any mapped URLs in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8000`). Check the compose file for exact ports.

**6. Test with penetration test tools (e.g. ZAP)**

**7. Stop & cleanup**

```powershell
# stop, keep volumes
docker compose down

# stop and remove volumes (fresh reset)
docker compose down -v
```

**8. Quick troubleshooting**

* `docker compose` not found → restart Docker Desktop; ensure PATH is updated.
* Permission / access denied → you probably need to log out/in after adding to `docker-users`. Reboot if needed.
* Ports already in use → run `Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort <port>).OwningProcess` or change mappings in an override.
* Container health problems → `docker logs <service-name>` and `docker compose ps`.

---

### 🍎 macOS + Docker

**1. Prerequisites**

* macOS (recent Big Sur / Monterey / Ventura or later).
* Docker Desktop for Mac (use the Apple Silicon build on M1/M2, or Intel build on Intel Macs).
* Terminal (zsh/bash).
* `curl` or `wget` (curl exists by default).
* (Optional) Homebrew for installing tools.

**2. Install Docker Desktop**

* Download & install Docker Desktop for Mac from Docker website.
* Start Docker Desktop and wait until the whale icon shows “Docker is running.”
* On first run Docker may request system permissions (network, virtualization). Accept those.
* On Apple Silicon, prefer images built for `arm64`; if an image lacks arm builds you can run `--platform linux/amd64` (see notes below).

**3. Create a working folder & download the compose file**

Open Terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/cyber-lab/phase1-part1
cd ~/cyber-lab/phase1-part1

# download compose file
curl -fsSLo docker-compose.yml "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vheikkiniemi/CybersecurityAndDataPrivacySpring2026/refs/heads/main/BookingSystem/Phase1/Part1/docker-compose.yml"
```

**4. Start the lab stack**

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Wait until services are `Up`. Open the app URLs in your browser (check `docker-compose.yml` for ports — usually `http://localhost:<port>`).

**5. Test with penetration test tools (e.g. ZAP)**

**6. Stop / reset:**

```bash
# stop containers (keep volumes/data)
docker compose down

# stop and remove volumes (fresh start)
docker compose down -v
```

**7. Docker Desktop settings to check (if problems)**

* **Resources**: increase memory/CPUs if containers are heavy.
* **File Sharing** (older Docker versions): ensure the project folder is allowed to be mounted into containers.
* **Use Rosetta**: not needed for Docker Desktop itself, but some CLI tools may behave differently on Intel images.

**8. Quick troubleshooting**

* **Docker not starting** → restart Docker Desktop; check `Docker Desktop > Troubleshoot` logs.
* **Container keeps restarting** → `docker logs <service>` to see the error.
* **Service unreachable** → `docker compose ps` and `docker inspect <container>` for port mapping; try `curl http://localhost:8000` locally.
* **Port already in use** → `lsof -i :<port>` to find conflicts or change port mapping in an override.
* **Permission / file mount errors** → check Docker Desktop file-sharing settings.

---

## 🏫 Centria CyberLab 

1. **Get access** via instructor/lab portal (you’ll receive credentials and lab rules).
2. **Start the provided lab stack** (services are preconfigured).
3. **Collect evidence** the same way (ZAP report + screenshots).
4. **Follow lab policies** strictly (no external testing, no internet exposure).

---

## ⚠️ Safety reminders 

* **Scope & permission:** Only test local applications.
* **No DoS:** Don’t run destructive tests unless explicitly allowed.
* **Local only:** Bind ports to `127.0.0.1` unless your instructor says otherwise.
* **Privacy:** Do not collect real personal data.
* **Clean up:** Use `docker compose down -v` to reset when done.

---

# 🧩 System Overview → Phase 1 / Part 1 Environment 

When you start the stack using

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

from [this compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vheikkiniemi/CybersecurityAndDataPrivacySpring2026/refs/heads/main/BookingSystem/Phase1/Part1/docker-compose.yml), you deploy a **small web application** and a **PostgreSQL database** inside isolated Docker containers.

---

## 🌐 Application access 

Once the containers are running, you can open the web application in your browser at:

```
http://<IP address>:8000
```

**What you will see:**

* A simple **booking system** interface that allows user registration.

> 💡 The application is intentionally minimal so you can focus on testing registration

---

## 🗄️ Database access (PostgreSQL) 

A PostgreSQL container runs alongside the web application. You can open an interactive SQL shell directly into the database using this command:

```bash
docker exec -it cybersec-db-phase1-part1 psql -U postgres -d postgres
```

Explanation:

* `docker exec -it` → runs a command inside the running database container.
* `cybersec-db-phase1-part1` → the container name defined in the compose file.
* `-U postgres` → login as the default PostgreSQL superuser.
* `-d postgres` → connect to the default database.

If the connection is successful, you’ll see the PostgreSQL prompt:

```
postgres=#
```

---

## 🧠 Exploring the database schema 

Inside the PostgreSQL shell, you can list all tables with:

```sql
\dt
```

This shows the current tables in the application’s database — for example:

```
   List of relations
 Schema |      Name       | Type  |  Owner
--------+-----------------+-------+----------
 public | booking_users   | table | postgres
```

---

## 👥 Viewing user data 

The application stores registered users in the table `booking_users`.
To view all user records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM booking_users;
```

You’ll see the current users, including those created during testing (e.g., when you register a new user through the web interface).

---

## 🧹 Cleaning up test users 

During testing, you may create many dummy accounts.
You can safely delete them with this SQL command:

```sql
DELETE FROM booking_users;
```

This clears the table but leaves the structure intact.

> ⚠️ **Be careful:** this command removes *all* users from the system. Only use it inside your lab environment — never on a production database.

---

## 🚪 Summary of key access points 

| Component         | Access Method                                                           | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| 🐘 Database Shell | `docker exec -it cybersec-db-phase1-part1 psql -U postgres -d postgres` | Open PostgreSQL interpreter inside the DB container          |
| 📋 List Tables    | `\dt`                                                                   | Shows all tables in the current database                     |
| 👤 Show Users     | `SELECT * FROM booking_users;`                                          | Displays user accounts currently stored                      |
| ❌ Delete Users    | `DELETE FROM booking_users;`                                            | Removes all users created during testing                     |

---

## 📜 Using Logs (e.g. Kali)

You can view and monitor the output (logs) of your running Docker containers with the `docker logs` command.
Logs are useful for debugging, monitoring performance, and confirming that services start correctly.

---

### 🧩 View web container logs

```bash
sudo docker logs cybersec-web-phase1-part1
```

Shows the existing log output from the **web application** container.

---

### 🔄 Follow web container logs in real time

```bash
sudo docker logs cybersec-web-phase1-part1 --follow
```

Displays new log entries as they appear (like `tail -f`).
**Stop following:** press **Ctrl + C** to return to the command line.

---

### 🧩 View database container logs

```bash
sudo docker logs cybersec-db-phase1-part1
```

Shows the existing log output from the **database** container.

---

### 🔄 Follow database container logs in real time

```bash
sudo docker logs cybersec-db-phase1-part1 --follow
```

Streams live logs from the database container, useful for monitoring queries or connection attempts.
**Stop following:** press **Ctrl + C**.

---

### ⚙️ Optional: limit the number of log lines

```bash
sudo docker logs cybersec-web-phase1-part1 --tail 100
```

Shows only the **last 100 lines** of logs — useful if the container has been running for a long time.

---

## ⚠️ (Again) Safe usage reminders 

* Always run this stack locally or in an approved lab (Centria CyberLab).
* Do **not** expose port 8000 to the public Internet.
* Database actions are for testing and learning only — don’t use real personal data.
* (Optional) Take screenshots or logs as evidence for your report
* After experiments, reset the environment with:

  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  ```
