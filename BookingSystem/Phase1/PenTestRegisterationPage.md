# 🔍 Penetration Tester’s Guide: Security Checks for User Account Creation

## *Understanding technical risks, privacy risks, and personal-data register implications*

When assessing a system’s account-creation process, a penetration tester must evaluate **both security weaknesses and privacy issues**, because creating an account automatically forms a **personal data register**. This makes the system subject to strict data-protection and security requirements.

This guide focuses on what an **entry-level penetration tester** should look for, test, and document.

---

## 1. 🧩 Data Minimization: What Data Is Collected?

### **Your task**

Understand that collecting personal data creates *risk*: more data = larger attack surface + higher GDPR responsibilities. As a tester, evaluate **whether the system collects only what is essential** and whether the purpose aligns with privacy principles.

* Identify **all fields** used during account creation.
* Determine if the system collects **more data than needed**.

### **Tests**

* List all fields in the signup form.
* Inspect hidden fields or background API calls.
* Check browser dev tools for extra data sent automatically (device data, fingerprinting).
* Compare form fields with the privacy notice.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Unnecessary personal information.
* Sensitive data collected without clear justification.
* Mismatches between data collected and stated purpose.

### **Red flags**

* Sensitive-data fields (health, ID numbers) without justification.
* Excessive profiling.
* Hidden tracking/fingerprinting/IP address without disclosure.

---

## 2. ⚖️ Lawful Basis and Transparency

### **Your task**

GDPR requires transparency. As a tester, check whether users are informed about **what happens to their data** and whether a lawful basis (contract, consent, etc.) is clearly communicated.

Check whether the system tells the user:

* Why data is collected
* How it will be used
* How long it will be stored
* Who has access
* How to invoke user rights

### **Tests**

* Look for a privacy notice during signup.
* Check if consent options exist and work (opt-in, opt-out).
* Inspect if data collection matches policy claims.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Clear explanation of purpose and legal basis.
* Information on rights, retention, data access.

### **Red flags**

* No privacy notice.
* Dark patterns to force consent.
* Collecting personal data not mentioned in the policy.

---

## 3. 🔐 Transport Security

### **Your task**

Account-creation traffic often includes credentials and personal data. Your task is to **ensure confidentiality and integrity** of this data in transit.

### **Tests**

* Attempt to access the site via HTTP.
* Check TLS version and cipher suites.
* Inspect network traffic for mixed content.
* Validate HSTS settings.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Strict HTTPS use.
* Proper TLS configuration.
* No insecure fallback behaviour.

### **Red flags**

* Plain HTTP allowed.
* No HSTS.
* Forms submitting to insecure endpoints.

---

## 4. 🛡️ Password Handling

### **Your task**

Weak password handling compromises authentication entirely. Test both **password strength controls** and **storage practices**, even indirectly.

### **Tests**

* Try weak passwords (“123456”, “password”).
* Look for password validation in frontend code.
* Trigger errors to check if backend reveals hashing algorithm.
* Inspect endpoints for password exposures.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, argon2id).
* Reasonable password requirements.
* No logging of credentials.

### **Red flags**

* Plaintext passwords.
* SHA1/SHA256 without salt.
* Passwords visible in logs or responses.

---

## 5. 🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### **Your task**

MFA reduces risk of credential compromise. As a tester, evaluate **availability, robustness, and bypass possibilities**.

### **Tests**

* Check if MFA is optional, required, or missing.
* Attempt MFA bypass via:

  * old session tokens
  * password reset flows
  * direct API calls

### **What you’re looking for**

* Consistent MFA enforcement.
* Secure token handling.
* Expiring MFA tokens.

### **Red flags**

* MFA bypass possible via unprotected endpoints.
* Non-expiring verification links.
* Session still valid after MFA reset.

---

## 6. 🛠️ Input Validation and Injection Testing

### **Your task**

Signup fields often interact with databases and rendering layers. These are **prime injection targets**.

### **Tests**

* XSS payloads in name/email (`<script>alert(1)</script>`).
* SQLi payloads (`' OR 1=1--`).
* HTML injection.
* Long input for overflow testing.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Proper sanitization.
* Escaping mechanisms.
* Backend validation instead of frontend only.

### **Red flags**

* Reflected XSS during signup.
* SQL errors indicating injection.
* Ability to modify HTML/headers at signup.

---

## 7. 🤖 Rate Limiting and Bot Protection

### **Your task**

Signup endpoints are targets for **spam, bots, fake accounts, and credential stuffing**. Assess whether automated creation is mitigated.

### **Tests**

* Rapid automated requests.
* Signup via multiple IPs/VPN.
* CAPTCHA presence and bypass attempts.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Rate limits.
* CAPTCHA or equivalent.
* Error messages that do not reveal too much.

### **Red flags**

* Unlimited account creation.
* No throttling.
* Missing or ineffective CAPTCHA.

---

## 8. 🍪 Session Handling and Security

### **Your task**

Session creation after signup must be secure. Weak session management enables **account hijacking**.

### **Tests**

* Inspect cookies for security flags.
* Try session fixation (set cookie before signup).
* Replay session tokens.
* Attempt to find session tokens in URLs.

### **What you’re looking for**

* `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` flags.
* Session rotation after signup.
* Unpredictable tokens.

### **Red flags**

* Session ID in URL.
* Missing cookie security flags.
* Session fixation possible.

---

## 9. 📘 Logging and Over-Logging

### **Your task**

Logging too much personal data creates **privacy and security liabilities**. You must ensure systems follow the `minimum necessary` principle.

### **Tests**

* Trigger failed logins or signup errors.
* Search logs for personal information.
* Inject unique strings to trace log propagation.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Minimal personal info logged.
* Logs protected by access control.

### **Red flags**

* Passwords or tokens logged.
* Full personal details logged.
* Logs accessible to unauthorized roles.

---

## 10. 🗃️ Personal Data Register Security

### **Your task**

Every new user becomes part of a **GDPR-bound personal data register**. Test how securely the system stores and organizes that data.

### **Tests**

* Review admin panel data exposure.
* Check DB encryption practices.
* Inspect backups and storage architecture.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Access control around user data.
* Minimal visible fields.
* Encryption at rest.

### **Red flags**

* Admins can view passwords.
* User enumeration.
* Unprotected DB files.

---

## 11. 🧑‍💼 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

### **Your task**

RBAC controls who can do what. Weak RBAC is a common source of **vertical and horizontal privilege escalation**.

### **Tests**

* Try accessing admin endpoints as a regular user.
* Try modifying other users’ data.
* Check differences between roles.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Strong separation between roles.
* Backend-enforced role checks.

### **Red flags**

* Ordinary users can access admin pages.
* Users can edit each other’s account data.
* Role decisions handled only by frontend.

---

## 12. ✉️ Email Verification

### **Your task**

Email verification establishes **identity ownership** of the account. Weak verification leads to fraud and impersonation.

### **Tests**

* Register without verifying email.
* Use expired/new/invalid tokens.
* Reuse old tokens.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Token expiration.
* Proper binding between token and account.
* No enumeration via verification errors.

### **Red flags**

* Email verification can be bypassed.
* Tokens never expire.
* Errors reveal whether an email is registered.

---

## 13. 🧹 Retention, Deletion, and Privacy Controls

### **Your task**

GDPR requires **purpose-based retention** and **complete deletion** when requested. Test if deletion actually removes data.

### **Tests**

* Create account → delete account → inspect DB & logs.
* Try logging in with old credentials.
* Check cached data or backups.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Data fully removed or anonymized.
* Retention rules consistent with policy.

### **Red flags**

* Deleted accounts still accessible.
* Personal data persists in backups indefinitely.
* “Soft delete” but data still visible.

---

## 14. 💾 Backup Security

### **Your task**

Backups contain full personal-data registers. If they are exposed, the entire system is compromised.

### **Tests**

* Look for public `.sql`, `.bak`, `.dump` files.
* Check directory browsing.
* Inspect whether backups are encrypted.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Encrypted, access-controlled backups.
* Minimal backup exposure.

### **Red flags**

* Backups in publicly accessible folders.
* Plaintext passwords inside backups.
* No encryption.

---

## 15. 📢 User Rights Handling

### **Your task**

GDPR gives users rights (access, deletion, rectification). Your job is to assess both **security** and **abuse possibilities** within these flows.

### **Tests**

* Request data export.
* Attempt account deletion.
* Try manipulating another user’s rights-related endpoints.

### **What you’re looking for**

* Identity verification before sensitive actions.
* Proper rate limits.
* Correct scope of returned data.

### **Red flags**

* Ability to delete someone else’s account.
* Data exports leaked to unauthorized users.
* No authentication for rights request actions.

## 📌 Summary for the Beginning Pentester

When testing user account creation, focus on:

### 🔴 High Priority

* Password security
* Injection vulnerabilities
* Session security
* Rate limiting
* Email verification bypass
* Excess logging
* Admin data exposure

### 🟠 Medium Priority

* Privacy policy inconsistencies
* Weak MFA flow
* Missing personal data rights UI

### 🟡 Low Priority

* Minor validation issues
* Cosmetic UI messaging that leaks small info

A user registration form is a **high-value attack surface**, because it sits at the intersection of:

* **Authentication security**
* **Personal data processing**
* **Web application logic**
* **Legal compliance**

Understanding these aspects makes you a stronger penetration tester and prepares you for more advanced testing scenarios.
