# 🔐 **GDPR Assignment**

## Initial scenario

> [!NOTE]  
> As a reminder

**You are a novice penetration tester at a company. Your company should implement the following application (specs):**  

1. The system is accessed via a web browser.  
2. Users can register and, after registration, log in to the system.  
3. A registered and logged-in user acts as either a resource reserver or an administrator.  
4. The administrator can add, remove, and modify resources and reservations.  
5. The administrator can delete the reserver.  
6. A reserver can book a resource if they are over 15 years old.  
7. Resources can be booked on an hourly basis.  
8. The booking system displays booked resources without requiring login, but does not show the reserver's identity  
9. The client, your company, requires that the system complies with GDPR regulations.  
10. The system provider has stated that the software is developed following the Privacy by Design (PbD) principle.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As a reminder: In the previous phase, the theme was authorization. In this phase, we focus on GDPR compliance.  
> **☝️ So focus only on GDPR.**
